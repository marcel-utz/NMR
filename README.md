# NMR
This project is about providing a set of routines and tools for NMR spectroscopy and imaging in Julia. It is currently in
an early experimental phase, and its structure and interface may change radically as the project evolves.

At this point, it provides:
- a simple plotting interface ```SimplePlot.jl```
- a home-built contour plotting routine: ```Contour.jl```
- a data type to represent graphical information, with easy output to SVG: ```SimpleGraphics.jl```
- routines supporting Hilbert space simulations of multi-spin systems: ```SpinSim.jl```

Use at your own risk :) !
